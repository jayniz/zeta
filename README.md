# Old Maid

```
TLDR:
- each service defines which objects it publishes or consumes
- these contracts are formatted in human readable markdown
- you never have to know/care about other services or repositories

Old Maid will:
- know the rest of your infrastructure and fetches the contracts of all other services
- alert you if your change in service X breaks service Y
```

In an infrastructure where many services are talking with each other, it's sometimes hard to know **how changes in one service affect other services**, as each project often just knows about itself. Even if local tests pass, you can't know what other services might be affected when you make changes to a service.

*Old Maid* tackles this problem by allowing each service to define which objects it consumes, and which objects it publishes - in simple Markdown (specifically [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/mson)).It doesn't matter if these objected are transported via a HTTP, a message broker like RabbitMQ or any other mean.


## Walk this way

Let's imagine an imaginary chat app that is split up into three independent services that communicate via a message broker:

- **MessageService** keeps track of the state of to do items
- **SearchService** makes your chat history searchable
- **NotificationService**: sends an email when a private message is received

Each time a message is sent, MessageService publishes the full message to the message broker. While the SearchService is likely interested in the full message with all of its properties to index it probably, the NotificationService might just care about the sender and the receiver of the message, discarding all other properties.

An intern is asked to implement a feature that allows one message to be sent to multiple people at the same time. They go ahead and just change the numerical `recepient_id` property of a message to an `recipient_ids` array. They run their tests and all looks good.

ðŸ˜±But **THE INTERN JUST BROKE THE NOTIFICATION SERVICE** because it depends on the `recipient_id` property ðŸ˜±

Wouldn't it be nice of some test local to the **MessageService** repository to tell the poorintern that removing the `recipient_id` property breaks the expectations other services have of the *MessageService* BEFORE they deploy?


## Yes, it would!

Each project have to contain two files in order for *Old Maid* to do its job:

1. `contracts/publish.mson`
2. `contracts/consume.mson`

These are simple markdown files in the wonderful [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/mson) format. Let's look at the contracts dir of **MessageService**, shall we?

### A publish specification:
```shell
/home/dev/message-service$ cat contracts/publish.mson
# Data Structures
This file defines what MessageService may publish.

# Message
- id: (number, required)
- sender_id: (number, required)
- recipients: (Array[number], required)
- text: (string, required)
- emoji: (string)
```

So far so good. This way *MessageService* can tell the world what exactly it means when a `Message` object is published. Much the same, the *NotificationService* could define which properties of a `Message` object from the `MessageService` it is actually interested in:

### A consume specification:
```shell
/home/dev/notification-service$ cat contracts/consume.mson
# Data Structures
We just consume one object type, and it comes from the MessageService. Check it out!

# MessageService:Message
- sender_id: (number, required)
- recipient_id: (number, required)
```

As you can see, this consumer expects the `recipient_id` property to be present when a `Message` object is received from `MessageService`. While a publish specification just defines objects, a consume specification prefixes the names of objects it consumes with the name of the service publishing the object. As in our example above:

```
# MessageService:Message
     |              `---------- object name
     `------------------------- service name

```

## Getting started

### 1. Installation
First, add *Old Maid* to your `Gemfile` or install manually:

```shell
$ gem install old-maid
```

### 2. Configuration

If you're using ruby on rails, *Old Maid* will automatically know your
environment and look for its configuration in `config/old-maid.yml`, which could look like this:

```yaml
common: &common
  # This name will be used by other services to identify objects they consume
  # from the MessageService
  service_name: MessageService

  # Which directory contains the publish.mson and consume.mson
  contracts_path: contracts

  # Where to cache the contracts from all other projects that are part of the
  # infrastructure. Old Maid will fetch these for you.
  contracts_cache_path: contracts/.cache


development:
  <<: *common
  # The services file contains all services that are part of your infrastructure
  # and tested with Old Maid. It's just another yaml file, but the nice thing is
  # that it's outside of the service's repository and has to be maintained only
  # in one place.
  services_file:

    # The file name to look for
    file: 'development.yml'

    # You can either host the file yourself via HTTP, but it's quite convenient
    # to have it version controlled and hosted by a service like github. We'll
    # call this repo old-maid-config for this example:
    github:
      repo: jensmander/old-maid-config
      branch: master
      path: infrastructure

# And here we can adjust things for each environment as needed
production:
  <<: *common
  ...

```

You typically just create the above file once and then don't touch it anymore. If that file is in a private repository (that would be a good idea), make sure you `export GITHUB_USERNAME=youruser` and `GITHUB_TOKEN=yourtoken` and *Old Maid* will use that.

Here's how `github.com/jensmander/old-maid-config/infrastructure/master.yml` might look in our example above:

```yaml
MessageService:
  github:
    repo: 'jensmander/messages'
    branch: 'master'
    path: 'contracts'
SearchService:
  github:
    repo: 'jensmander/search'
    branch: 'master'
    path: 'contracts'
NotificationService:
  github:
    repo: 'jensmander/notifications'
    branch: 'master'
    path: 'contracts'
```

Whenever you add a service to the infrastructure, you just add it to this central file and all existing services will automatically know about your new service.


### 3. Usage

```shell
Usage: old-maid [options] full_check|fetch_remote_contracts|update_own_contracts|validate

Specific options:
    -c, --config=CONFIG_FILE         Config file (default: config/old-maid.yml)
    -e, --env=ENVIRONMENT            Environment (default: RAILS_ENV, if it is set)
    -s, --silent                     No output, just an appropriate return code

Common options:
    -h, --help                       Show this message
    -v, --version                    Show version
```

Example time. You can tell *Old Maid* to validate the whole infrastructure like this:

```shell
$ old-maid -e development full_check
```

The above command performs the following three steps:

1. Fetch all contracts from remote repositories and put them into the cache directory configured above
2. Copy the current projects contracts (that you might have changed) into the cache directory
3. Validate all contracts (i.e. make sure that every publishing service satisfies its consumers)

The above commands can also be run in isolation:

```shell
$ old-maid -e development fetch_contracts
```

This command will populate the `contracts/.cache` directory with the current version of all contracts and then copy over your local changes to your contract. You can then validate your infrastructure like this:

```shell
$ old-maid -e development validate
```

If you just made changes to your local contracts, you can copy them over to the cache and validate your infrastructure like this:

```shell
$ old-maid -e development update_own_contracts validate
```

Otherwise it will exit with an error and display any contract violations in JSON.
